Loan Approval Prediction | Machine Learning Project

1)Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant financial and demographic information.

The goal is to automate and optimize the loan approval decision process using data-driven predictive modeling.

2) Business Problem

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily.

Manual approval processes are:

Time-consuming

Prone to bias

Inefficient

This project aims to develop a predictive model that can:

Improve approval accuracy

Reduce financial risk

Speed up loan decision-making

3)Dataset Description

The dataset contains applicant information such as:

Gender

Marital Status

Education

Self Employed

Applicant Income

Coapplicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit History

Property Area

Loan Status (Target Variable)

4)Project Workflow

5)Key Insights

Credit History is the strongest predictor of loan approval.

Applicants with higher income and stable employment have higher approval probability.

Property area also influences loan decisions.

Random Forest achieved the best performance among tested models.
